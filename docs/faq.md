  <summary>does snapr provide an unconditional basic income?</summary>
  
  #### does snapr provide an unconditional or universal basic income?
  
  > snapr is available to every human, without exception and without charge at a rate of 1 unit per human per day until the supply is exhausted.  
  there are technical challenges around ensuring that an individual only maintains a single identity and those challenges necessitate some safeguards that may increase the difficulty some humans experience in gaining access to the snapr they are entitled to.  
  snapr endeavours to set the bar to access as low as practicable and we welcome assistance and ideas on how that bar may be lowered further without compromising on the caveat that no human should obtain more than the fair share all humans are entitled to.
