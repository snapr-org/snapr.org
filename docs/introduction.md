## what is snapr?

snapr is a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, ethereum or polkadot.

it is implemented as a [substrate](https://substrate.io) based blockchain using [nominated proof of stake](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/index.html), much like polkadot.

there is a total supply of 30,559,198,855,434.0 (thirty point five trillion) snapr. it is a fixed supply and cannot be increased. the total supply was calculated using [united nations population projections](https://population.un.org/wpp/) for the ten year period following the public launch of snapr. the supply is intended to be distributed to any human requesting it at a rate of 1 unit of snapr daily until the supply is exhausted, which may or may not occur in about ten years time.

## using snapr

snapr is still in development, so it's not very easy to use right now. however, if you are familiar with substrate tools, like polkadot.js, you may create a wallet and associate it with your signed identity. the intent is to commence distribution of snapr to wallets associated with a unique, signed identity as early as possible.

in the spirit of decentralisation, anyone who already has a signed identity, may sign the identity of anyone they know and trust to be using only one unique identity. credibility with the distribution algorithm may be won or lost by providing signatures to honest or dishonest identities respectively (see: [signatures](identity/signatures)).
