# carers and guardians

## eligibility for payouts in respect of minors and those in care

carers and guardians may take responsibility for creation and management of (snapr) identity on behalf of those for whom they are caring.

guardians must annotate the created identity to note that it was created on behalf of a person in their care.

a guardian may sign identities they have created but should consider that if their own identity loses eligibility for payouts (through signature revocation or otherwise), then those in their care may also lose eligibility for payouts if they do not have an alternative signatory.
