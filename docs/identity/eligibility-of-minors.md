# eligibility of minors (for daily payouts)

at this stage it is not known how eligibility for payouts will be determined for minors. speaking from a technical implementation perspective:

- if **minors are not eligible** for payouts,
  - then identity may require:
    - a date of birth must be associated with each identity.
    - a residency locale must be kept up to date in order to determine the date of eligibility for payouts when the age of majority for the locale of residence is reached.
  - alternatively, an identity signer may assert that the identity being signed for, has reached the age of majority in the locale in which they reside

- if **legal guardian(s) are eligible** for payouts on behalf of a minor, then identity requires:
  - a date of birth must be associated with each identity.
  - a residency locale must be kept up to date in order to determine the date of eligibility for payouts when the age of majority for the locale of residence is reached.
  - the identity of a minor must be associated with one or more legal guardians to whom payouts may be made.

- if minors **are eligible** for payouts, then either:
  - identity requires no additional information. legal guardians may simply create an identity for each minor in their care and reliquish control of associated payouts when they see fit.
  - identity may require a date of birth and a residency locale, in order to enforce the passing of control of payouts when the age of majority is reached.
  - identity may require a date of birth. control of payouts is transfered at an internationally recognised (or international average) age of majority.
  
discussion and advice on this complex subject is welcome and sought.
